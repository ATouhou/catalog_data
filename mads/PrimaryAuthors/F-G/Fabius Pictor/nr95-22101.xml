The name, which otherwise appears as Fabius Pictor without forename, attaches to two works, one a Latin annuals of the history of Rome, the other a study of the duties of the pontifices. Generally it can be assumed that besides the old annalist Q. Fabius Pictor, there was a  younger FabiusPictor active two generations later (154-151 B.C.), but his praenomen cannot be readily established)</subfield></datafield><datafield ind1=" " ind2=" " tag="670"><subfield code="a">Dict. of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, 1967:</subfield><subfield code="b">v. 3, p. 364; "Pictor", #6 (Ser.
